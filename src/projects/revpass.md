The sports pass is a seasonal ticket that gives access to all home games at Texas A&M. When students are unable to attend a game, a common practice is selling the physical sports pass to another student. However, the lack of standardization relies solely on trust between the buyer and seller. By leveraging the decentralized and secure nature of blockchains, we want to create a transparent and fair market for the selling and transfer of sports passes.
