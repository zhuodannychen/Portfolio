As part of my CSCE 482 Capstone project at Texas A&M, we developed a command-line tool that converts 3D CAD files into 2D PDF previews. The tool automatically generates detailed metadata and visual representations, including six orthographic views and a 3D rendered preview of the model. Our goal was to make it easier for CAD creators to share and document their designs without needing to rebuild or manually export each model. This was built on top of the BRL-CAD open-source framework, and the project earned 3rd place and a $500 prize in the TAMU Capstone showcase.
