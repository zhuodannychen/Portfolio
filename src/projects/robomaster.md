The RoboMaster program is a robotic competition founded by DJI. Robots from two teams battle each other on the arena by shooting pellets at armor plates mounted on the robots. Computer vision is widely used on the robots to track and detect opponent robots and perform autoaiming and shooting. In this repo, I train a CV model using darknet and YOLOv4.
