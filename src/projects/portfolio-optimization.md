Assuming you have $100 and there are N assets, how much money should you put into each asset to generate maximum profit? The Modern Portfolio Theorem refers to a tradeoff between risk and return. How can we allocate capital to maximize the returns given a certain level of risk? Similarly, how can we minimize risk given a certain level of return? There is no unique solution, but rather, a set of solutions that form what is called the efficient frontier. We explore the Global Minimum Variance and Max Sharpe methods.
